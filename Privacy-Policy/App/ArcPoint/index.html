        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> February 3, 2026</p>
        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>ArcPoint</strong> ("we", "our", or "the App") handles your
            information. ArcPoint is developed with privacy as a priority.</p>

        <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
        <p>ArcPoint is designed to be a local-first application. We do not collect, store, or transmit any of your
            personal data to external servers. All information you enter into the App, including novel data, reading
            progress, and settings, is stored locally on your device.</p>

        <h2>2. Permissions</h2>
        <p>To provide its features, the App may request the following permissions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Internet:</strong> Used only for features you explicitly trigger, such as opening external web
                links to novels.</li>
            <li><strong>Storage/Media:</strong> Used to allow you to select and display images (covers) for your novels.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The App may contain links to third-party websites (e.g., novel hosting sites). We are not responsible for the
            privacy practices or content of these external sites.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device, your data remains on your device until you choose to delete
            the App or its data manually.</p>

        <h2>5. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new
            Privacy Policy on this page.</p>

        <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions or suggestions about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us at
            <strong>fairyprisme@gmail.com</strong>.
