    <h1>Privacy Policy for ChalkMark</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 23, 2026</p>

    <p>ChalkMark ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains our
        practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of your information when you use the ChalkMark
        application (the "App").</p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection and Usage</h2>
    <p>ChalkMark is a fully offline application designed to help you manage your attendance and timetable. <strong>We do
            not collect, transmit, store on external servers, or share any of your personal data.</strong></p>

    <h2>2. Local Storage</h2>
    <p>All data you enter into the App &mdash; including subjects, timetables, attendance records, and tasks &mdash; is
        stored strictly locally on your device using a local database format. If you uninstall the app or clear its
        data, your records will be permanently deleted from your device. We have no access to this data.</p>

    <h2>3. Permissions Required</h2>
    <p>To function properly, ChalkMark requires certain permissions on your device. These permissions are used strictly
        for local app features:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Notifications & Alarms:</strong> Used exclusively to deliver scheduled local reminders for classes,
            attendance, and tasks. These notifications are generated and scheduled entirely on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Internet:</strong> The app requests this permission for potential future features (such as in-app
            policies), but does not currently use it to transmit any of your personal data over the internet.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We do not use any third-party analytics, tracking, or advertising services in the App. No data analytics are
        gathered about your usage of the App.</p>

    <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our App does not intentionally target children under the age of 13, and since we do not collect any personal
        information whatsoever, we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy
        Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this
        Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>

    <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
