        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> February 24, 2026</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>We respect your privacy.</strong> "Stone Paper Scissor Reflex" is a standalone,
                family-friendly game. It does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, transmit, or share any personal
                information. What happens on your device stays on your device.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>1. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
        <p>When you download and play "Stone Paper Scissor Reflex", we do not require you to provide any personal
            information. We do not collect names, email addresses, phone numbers, location data, or any other personally
            identifiable information (PII).</p>

        <h2>2. How the Game Works (Local Data Only)</h2>
        <p>Your game progress, including your high score, earned coins, and unlocked skins, is saved entirely
            <strong>locally on your device</strong>. This data is never uploaded to external servers or accessible to
            us. If you uninstall the game, this data will be deleted.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Device Sensor Usage</h2>
        <p>The game utilizes your device's <strong>accelerometer sensor</strong> to control the horizontal movement of
            the player object via tilting. This sensor data is processed locally in real-time solely for gameplay
            mechanics. It is never recorded, stored, or transmitted over the internet.</p>

        <h2>4. Required Permissions</h2>
        <p>The application requires the following Android permission:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>INTERNET:</strong> This permission is required by the underlying framework (specifically for
                rendering optimal fonts) when the game starts. The game does not use this permission to track you, show
                remote ads, or upload any user data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our game is built for everyone, including children. In compliance with the Children's Online Privacy
            Protection Act (COPPA) and similar global regulations, we do not knowingly collect personal information from
            children under the age of 13. Because our app does not collect any personal data from any user, children are
            inherently protected.</p>

        <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The game currently does not integrate any third-party analytics, tracking, or advertising networks. There are
            no embedded trackers in the application.</p>

        <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any material changes, we will update the "Last
            Updated" date at the top of this policy. We encourage you to review this page periodically for any changes.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions or suggestions about our Privacy Policy, please do not hesitate to contact the
            developer directly at:</p>
