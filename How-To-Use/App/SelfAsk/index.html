    <h1>How to Use SelfAsk</h1>

    <section>
        <h2>Welcome to Your Quiet Space</h2>
        <p>SelfAsk is more than just a journal or a note-taking app. It is a quiet, reflective space designed for your
            mind. Life is full of lingering thoughts, unresolved feelings, and profound questions that we carry with us
            every day.</p>
        <p>This application gives you a safe place to store those questions, giving you the clarity and peace of mind
            that comes from simply acknowledging what you are going through. Over time, as you evolve, you can watch
            your own answers change alongside you.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Planting a Seed of Thought</h2>
        <p>Whenever you find yourself unsure, curious, or deeply contemplative, open the app and tap on the <strong>Add
                Question</strong> button on the home screen.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Step 1: The Question</strong> - Write down the question you are living right now. It could be
                something as grand as your life's purpose or as simple as your feelings about the day.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 2: Your Current Thought</strong> - Before saving, take a moment to write down your initial
                perspective or current thought. This captures your state of mind at this very instance.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Revisiting Your Journey</h2>
        <p>In the <strong>Questions</strong> section, you will find all the seeds you have planted. Healing and
            understanding take time. We encourage you to revisit these questions days, weeks, or even months later.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Tap on any question to view the timeline of your thoughts.</li>
            <li>As you gather new experiences and perspectives, you can add a new thought to an existing question,
                creating a beautiful timeline of your personal growth.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>The Seasons of Growth</h2>
        <p>Your thoughts and feelings naturally transition. To help you structure your inner journey, each question
            holds a specific status that you can update as you progress:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Open:</strong> You are currently seeking an answer or reflecting on this actively.</li>
            <li><strong>Changed:</strong> Your perspective has shifted, but the question still remains relevant.</li>
            <li><strong>Resolved:</strong> You have found peace or a concrete answer to this question.</li>
            <li><strong>Archived:</strong> This question is a part of your past, gently tucked away for you to look back
                on.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>A Gentle Reminder</h2>
        <p>There is no right or wrong way to use SelfAsk. Some days you may write volumes, and other days, a single
            sentence is enough. Be gentle with yourself. Take a deep breath, pause, and let your journey unfold
            naturally.</p>
