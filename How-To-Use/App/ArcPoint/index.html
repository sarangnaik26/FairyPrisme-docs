        <h1>How to Use ArcPoint</h1>
        <p>Welcome to <span class="highlight">ArcPoint</span>, your personal, local-first novel tracking application.
            This definitive guide will help you understand how to navigate the app, manage your reading progress
            efficiently, and make the most out of all our available features.</p>

        <div class="alert">
            <strong>Key Information:</strong> ArcPoint operates entirely offline. All your data, including your reading
            progress, cover images, and bucket lists, is securely stored directly on your device. We do not sync your
            data to the cloud.
        </div>

        <h2>Detailed App Description</h2>
        <p>ArcPoint is a comprehensive tracking tool explicitly tailored for avid readers. It allows you to
            systematically organize your novel-reading journey by keeping track of the books you are currently reading,
            the ones you want to read next, and the ones you have successfully finished.</p>
        <p>With ArcPoint, you have a detailed dashboard for every single novel. You can seamlessly assign cover images
            from your local storage to customize your library's appearance, effortlessly update your latest read
            chapter, maintain detailed personal notes, and utilize our powerful global search tools to instantly find
            what you're looking for.</p>

        <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

        <h3>1. Home Screen (Currently Reading)</h3>
        <p>The Home Screen is your main operational hub. It clearly displays all the novels you are actively engaging
            with. From here, you can quickly glance at your reading progress.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Add a New Novel:</strong> Tap the central "Add" floating action button to create a new entry for
                a novel you have started reading. You will be prompted to enter its title and other foundational
                details.</li>
            <li><strong>Access Dashboards:</strong> Simply tap on any novel featured on the Home Screen to seamlessly
                enter its unique dashboard and update your reading status.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Novel Dashboard</h3>
        <p>Opening a novel’s dashboard unlocks its complete management suite, where you can modify specific information
            about your progress and the novel itself.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cover Images:</strong> Ensure a visually pleasing library by selecting an image directly from
                your device's media gallery to set as the novel's cover art.</li>
            <li><strong>Chapter Tracking:</strong> Easily log the latest chapter you read using the intuitive progress
                counter buttons.</li>
            <li><strong>Details & Notes:</strong> Write and maintain personal summaries, reviews, or thoughts about the
                storyline in the dedicated notes section.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Bucket List (Want to Read)</h3>
        <p>The Bucket List section is specifically designed for all the novels you are highly interested in beginning
            but haven't officially started reading yet.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Add fresh books here to maintain a centralized, organized backlog of your future reading plans.</li>
            <li>Once you officially commence reading a book from your Bucket List, you can utilize the moving options to
                instantly transfer it directly to your active Home Screen list.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Completed Screen</h3>
        <p>Think of this space as your personal trophy room! All the novels you have entirely finished are securely
            archived here.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>When you confidently mark a novel as "completed" from its individual dashboard, it will be automatically
                transitioned and showcased in this specific list.</li>
            <li>You can indefinitely revisit these completed novels to reminisce, re-view your old notes, or evaluate
                your past completion logs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5. Global Search Functionality</h3>
        <p>If you have too many novels to manually scroll through, the Global Search feature allows you to instantly
            pinpoint any novel across all your existing lists.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Navigate to the search screen via the bottom navigation bar and start typing the exact or partial title
                of the novel.</li>
            <li>The robust search engine will instantly and simultaneously look through your Home Screen, Bucket List,
                and Completed lists to provide real-time results.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Managing Your Data</h2>
        <p>To ensure a completely seamless and highly private local-first experience, ArcPoint handles all data
            management directly on your mobile device:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Local Image Handling:</strong> When you select and set a cover image for a novel, it is uniquely
                copied and stored locally within the app's secure documents directory. If you decide to delete a novel,
                its specifically associated images and data are also safely, automatically removed to immediately free
                up space on your device.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Permanence:</strong> Because absolutely nothing is transmitting to external cloud servers,
                please be extremely careful not to accidentally uninstall the application or prematurely clear its core
                application data from your phone settings unless you intentionally intend to permanently delete all your
                tracking history.</li>
        </ul>
